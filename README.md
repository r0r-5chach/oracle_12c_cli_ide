# oracle_12c_cli_ide

This code was to made to make accessing my university CSY1026 module database server easier and also allowed the running of scripts.
Editing was also made possible by opening the files in vscode.

All operations are achieved using native libraries os and subprocess

This code is not usable unless you have been given the specific binaries from the module tutors at the University of Northampton
